# AiMine-A-C-Library-for-Building-AI-Models-from-Scratch-

**AiMine** is a C library for building artificial intelligence models from scratch. AiMine seamlessly combines powerful data manipulation, mathematical functions, and cutting-edge neural network algorithms in a single, flexible library.


## Features

- **CSV Manipulation**: Easily read, display, and extract data from CSV files.
  - `read_csv`: Read CSV files into datasets.
  - `display`: Display dataset content with customizable row viewing.
  - `extract_column`: Extract specific columns.
  - `extract_row`: Extract specific rows.

- **Data Preprocessing**: Normalize and preprocess data with robust, built-in functions.
  - Normalization functions like `standard_scaler`, `min_max_scaler`, and `robust_scaler`.
  - Utility functions such as `find_min`, `find_max`, `median`, and `iqr`.

- **Data Preparation**: Split and shuffle datasets for model training.
  - Functions like `shuffle` for randomizing data order.
  - Tools to create training and testing datasets.

- **Mathematical Operations**: Perform vector and matrix operations.
  - Functions for vector and matrix multiplications.

- **Neural Networks**: Build and train neural networks with a flexible architecture.
  - Supports custom layers, activation functions (ReLU, Tanh, Sigmoid, Softmax), and dropout for regularization.
  - Includes forward propagation and backpropagation for model training.

- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate model performance with built-in accuracy functions.
